# Download git and pull the shape_analysis_exercises repository

If you do an online search for git, you should find the project website [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/). It will tell you how to download it.

Once you have git installed, you can clone the remote repository hosted on github to a local repository on your computer. 
[Here](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/remote-repositories/introduction/) is a web article which explains how working with remote repositories works.

To do this, create a folder for your repositories and then run the following command from within that folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/michael-m-rosenthal/shape_analysis_exercises.git
```

Optionally, you can specify the path of the directory you wish to clone the remote repository to with something similar to the command below:

```
git clone https://github.com/michael-m-rosenthal/shape_analysis_exercises.git /path/to/where/i/want/local/repository
```
